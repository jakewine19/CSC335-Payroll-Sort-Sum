# Assignment 1

This assignment serves as a quick introductory practice to C programming, setting the stage for more complex assignments later. 
You are to perform the following programming tasks:

### Programming Task 1: 5 points

Implement **payroll.c** with the following specifications:

- The program will accept four command line arguments (in this order) of types string of characters (last name, no white space), string of characters (first name, no white space), int (minutes worked), and double (hourly rate). 
- The program will calculate the total payment as a product of time worked and hourly rate. 
- The program will print out the result to console using the following format (total payment should be printed with two decimal places): 

firsts_name last_name: total_payment


### Programming Task 2: 10 points

Implement **sum.c** with the following specifications: 

- The program will accept a single command line argument representing the path to a text file containing the values of these integers. 
  - There will be one integer per line. 
  - There will be ten lines. 
- The program will read these ten integers from the text file in part a into an array of integers. 
- The program will print out the sum of these integers. 

### Programming Task 3: 10 points

Implement **sort.c** with the following specifications:

- The program will accept a single command line argument representing the path to a text file containing the values of these integers. 
  - There will be multiple integers per line.
  - Integers on the same line are separated by a single space. 
  - The number of lines, and the number of integers per line are unknown.  
- The program will read all integers from the text file in part a into an array of integers.
- The program will sort this array of integers in ascending order (any sorting technique can be used).  
- The program will print out the sorted array on a single line, with the individual array elements separated by a single space.

## Submission

- Edit the README.md to add your name to the top of the file
- Submit the URL of your assignment git repository, as provided through GitHub Classroom to D2L. 
- Besides the three required files, you must not make any changes to the existing test files or test script. 
- The last commit to your git repository must be made prior to the deadline of the assignment. Any subsequent commit will not be considered.
